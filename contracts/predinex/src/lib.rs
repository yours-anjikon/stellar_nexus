// ── Issue #175: Event schema versioning ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every event emitted by this contract uses the same topic layout:
//
//   (Symbol(event_name), Symbol(EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION), ...identifiers)
//
// Topic position 0 is the event name (e.g. `create_pool`). Topic position 1 is
// always the schema version marker (currently `"v1"`). Subsequent topics carry
// pool / user identifiers as before. Indexers and frontend consumers can
// therefore pin a specific schema version with a positional topic filter, e.g.
// `[["create_pool", "v1"]]`, and reject events whose version they do not yet
// understand instead of silently mis-decoding payloads.
//
// Upgrade rules for future schema changes:
//   * A backward-compatible payload extension (additional optional fields)
//     SHOULD reuse the same version marker.
//   * A breaking change to topics or data shape MUST bump the version marker
//     (e.g. `"v2"`) and be documented in `web/docs/CONTRACT_EVENTS.md`.
//   * The contract MUST never emit two version markers for the same event in
//     the same release; consumers can rely on exactly one version per event.
//
// See `web/docs/CONTRACT_EVENTS.md` for the full per-event schema and the
// upgrade expectations published to consumers.
pub const EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION: &str = "v1";

/// #191 — Contract state schema version for on-chain compatibility checks.

/// backward-incompatible way. Stored under `DataKey::ContractVersion`.
