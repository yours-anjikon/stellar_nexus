# Stellar Goal Vault

Stellar Goal Vault is a lightweight crowdfunding MVP for the Stellar ecosystem.

It includes:

- A React dashboard to create and manage funding campaigns
- A Node.js + Express API backed by SQLite
- A Soroban contract scaffold for on-chain campaign creation, pledges, claims, and refunds
- A seeded contribution backlog you can turn into GitHub issues after publishing

## What the project does?

Creators open a campaign with a target amount and deadline.

Contributors can pledge until the deadline:

- If the target is reached, the creator can claim the vault
- If the target is missed, contributors can refund their pledges

This repo is intentionally scoped as an MVP so it is easy to extend with wallet signing, event indexing, and production-grade UX.

## Current architecture

Frontend (`frontend`, port `3000`)

- React + Vite dashboard
- Campaign board, detail panel, timeline, and contribution backlog
- Uses `/api` proxy for backend calls
- Freighter-backed pledge flow that simulates, signs, submits, and then reconciles local state

Backend (`backend`, port `3001`)

- Express REST API
- SQLite persistence for campaigns, pledges, and event history
- Real-time campaign status derived from current timestamps and stored pledges
- Exposes contract/network config to the frontend and reconciles confirmed pledge hashes

Contract (`contracts`)

- Soroban Rust scaffold
- Implements `create_campaign`, `contribute`, `claim`, `refund`, `get_campaign`, and `get_contribution`
- Not yet wired into live wallet signing flow in the frontend

Architecture decision records

- Key architecture choices are documented in `adr/`.
- Mermaid architecture diagrams are documented in `docs/architecture.md`.
- See `adr/0001-sqlite-off-chain-mvp.md` for the SQLite off-chain MVP decision.
- See `adr/0002-react-express-mvp.md` for the React + Express + Soroban MVP architecture decision.

## Core campaign model

Each campaign stores:

- `creator`
- `title`
- `description`
- `assetCode`
- `targetAmount`
- `pledgedAmount`
- `deadline`

Campaign states:

- `open` when deadline has not passed and target is not yet met
- `funded` when pledged amount is at least the target and funds have not been claimed
- `claimed` when the creator has claimed a funded vault
- `failed` when deadline has passed without reaching the target

## API reference

Base URL:

- Local backend: `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend proxy: `/api`

### `GET /api/health`

- Service health check
- Response:

```json
{
  "service": "stellar-goal-vault-backend",
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-27T21:30:00.000Z",
  "uptimeSeconds": 12.345,
  "database": {
    "status": "up",
    "reachable": true
  }
}
```

- `status` is `ok` when the API and database probe succeed, otherwise `degraded`
- `database.status` is `up` or `down` based on a lightweight SQLite reachability check

### `GET /api/campaigns`

- Returns all campaigns with computed progress
- Query parameters:
  - `q` (optional): Search query to filter campaigns by title, creator, or campaign ID (case-insensitive)
  - `asset` (optional): Filter campaigns by asset code (e.g., USDC, XLM)
  - `status` (optional): Filter campaigns by status (open, funded, claimed, failed)

### `GET /api/campaigns/:id`

- Returns one campaign with pledges and event history

### `POST /api/campaigns`

- Create a campaign

Request body:

- `creator`
- `title`
- `description`

- `maxPerContributor` (optional): Maximum total pledge amount a single contributor can contribute to this campaign. If not set, no per-contributor limit applies. Can also be set globally via `DEFAULT_MAX_PER_CONTRIBUTOR` env variable.

### `POST /api/campaigns/:id/pledges`

- Add a pledge to a live campaign

Request body:

- `contributor`
- `amount`

### `POST /api/campaigns/:id/pledges/reconcile`

- Record a confirmed on-chain pledge locally after the Soroban transaction succeeds

Request body:

- `contributor`
- `amount`
- `transactionHash`
- `confirmedAt` (optional)

### `POST /api/campaigns/:id/claim`

- Claim a funded campaign after deadline

Request body:

- `creator`

### `POST /api/campaigns/:id/refund`

- Refund all active pledges from one contributor on a failed campaign

Request body:

- `contributor`

### `GET /api/campaigns/:id/history`

- Fetch local event history for the selected campaign

### `GET /api/campaigns/:id/contributors`

Returns contributor summary (grouped pledges with refund status).

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "contributor": "GBEZH6T5V7VHUWGMAHVICBFV7WSNULSIHHMV7B2LFNJA6J3XVMT7M2LVY",
      "totalPledged": 150.0,
      "refundedAmount": 0,
      "isFullyRefunded": false
    },
    {
      "contributor": "GABC123...",
      "totalPledged": 0,
      "refundedAmount": 50.0,
      "isFullyRefunded": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Empty campaigns return `{"data": []}`. Invalid IDs return 404.

### `GET /api/open-issues`

- Returns seeded issue ideas for public open-source contribution

## Run locally

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Optional for contract work: Rust + Soroban toolchain

From repo root:

```bash
npm run install:all
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:frontend
```

Open:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Local development with Docker (hot-reload)

A `docker-compose.override.yml` is included for local development. Docker Compose merges it automatically with `docker-compose.yml` when you run `docker compose up`, so no extra flags are needed.

What the override does:

- Mounts `./frontend/src` and `./backend/src` into each container so that file changes are reflected immediately without rebuilding the image.
- Runs `npm run dev` for both services (Vite dev server for the frontend, `ts-node-dev` for the backend).
- Exposes Vite's HMR WebSocket port `24678` to the host.

```bash
# Build images and start both services with hot-reload
docker compose up --build

# Or in the background
docker compose up --build -d
```

Stop and remove containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## API load testing

The backend includes a configurable load test script built with `autocannon` to simulate concurrent campaign reads and pledge writes.

1. Start the backend locally:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

2. In a second terminal, run the load test:

```bash
cd backend
npm run load:test -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:3001 --connections 20 --duration 20
```

The script seeds synthetic campaigns first, then runs a mixed workload across:

- `GET /api/campaigns`
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id`
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/pledges`

The console output includes:

- Latency percentiles (`p50`, `p90`, `p97.5`, `p99`, `max`)
- Error rate, timeout count, and non-2xx responses
- Average requests per second and throughput

Useful flags:

- `--connections <number>`: concurrent connections
- `--duration <seconds>`: test duration
- `--campaigns <number>`: number of seed campaigns created before the run
- `--read-weight <number>`: relative share of campaign read requests
- `--pledge-weight <number>`: relative share of pledge requests
- `--pledge-amount <number>`: amount sent in each pledge request
- `--target-amount <number>`: target amount assigned to each seed campaign
- `--asset-code <code>`: asset code used while seeding campaigns
- `--deadline-hours <hours>`: how far into the future seeded campaign deadlines are set

Example validation run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run load:test -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:3001 --duration 5 --connections 5 --campaigns 4 --read-weight 3 --pledge-weight 2
```

## Deploy contract

Set a funded Stellar testnet secret key and run:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="S..." npm run deploy:contract
```

The script will:

1. Build the Soroban contract
2. Deploy to Stellar testnet
3. Output the contract ID
4. Save the ID to `contracts/contract_id.txt`

## Environment variables

Backend:

- `PORT` defaults to `3001`
- `DB_PATH` defaults to `backend/data/campaigns.db`
- `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` defaults to Stellar testnet RPC
- `CONTRACT_ID` is required for Freighter pledge signing
- `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` defaults to Stellar testnet
- `CONTRACT_AMOUNT_DECIMALS` defaults to `2` and controls display-to-contract unit scaling

Frontend:

- `VITE_API_URL` defaults to `/api`

Contract deployment:

- `SECRET_KEY` required
- `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` optional
- `RPC_URL` optional

## Open-source ready next steps

`Implement Freighter-signed pledge transactions`

That issue is already represented in:

- `backend/src/services/openIssues.ts`
- `OPEN_SOURCE_ISSUES.md`
- The frontend backlog panel

## Contributing

Please see the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and contribution guidelines.

## Known limitations

- Campaign creation is still local-first, so pledges will only simulate successfully for campaign IDs that also exist in the configured contract
- No authentication or rate limiting on write endpoints
- No background indexer for on-chain event sync yet

## Suggested roadmap

- Replace mock pledge actions with Freighter + Soroban transactions
- Index on-chain events into SQLite
- Add filters, sorting, and campaign pages
- Add contract tests and backend integration tests

## New feature: Dark mode toggle

The frontend now includes a theme toggle in the header with icon controls for light/dark mode.

- Toggle between light and dark themes directly in the UI
- Persist selected theme in `localStorage` using `stellar-goal-vault-theme`
- Respect system `prefers-color-scheme` on first load when no saved theme exists
- Apply dark/light color variants across core UI surfaces (cards, tables, forms, buttons, and controls)
